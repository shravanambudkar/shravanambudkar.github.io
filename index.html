									👋 ¡Hola a todos! A mis 25 años puedo afirmar rotúndamente que soy un apasionado de la informática y la enseñanza. He estado inmerso en el fascinante mundo de la tecnología desde que era un niño y desde entonces, he recorrido un largo camino académico y profesional.<br><br> Mi viaje comenzó con un Grado Superior en Desarrollo Web, seguido de un Grado en Ingeniería Informática en la UCAM, y luego un Máster en Nuevas Tecnologías en Informática en la Universidad de Murcia.<br><br> Actualmente, estoy trabajando en mi doctorado, mientras tengo el privilegio de dar clases en la Universidad de Murcia.
								</div>
							</div>
							<div>
								En mi experiencia docente, he encontrado que cada estudiante es único y merece un <span class="underline">enfoque de enseñanza personalizado</span> que se ajuste a sus propias necesidades y ritmo de aprendizaje. Por ello, mi objetivo principal es brindar una enseñanza de calidad y adaptada a cada uno de mis alumnos, con posibilidad de <span class="underline">enseñanza en Inglés y Castellano</span>. Estos son algunos de mis enfoques de enseñanza:
								<br><br>
								<ol>
									<li><b>Apoyo constante</b>: Estoy disponible para resolver dudas o proporcionar ayuda adicional cuando sea necesario. Creo que la comunicación abierta y regular es clave para un aprendizaje efectivo. 📞</li>
									<li><b>Herramientas innovadoras</b>: Utilizo herramientas de última generación para facilitar el aprendizaje y hacer que incluso los conceptos más complejos sean comprensibles. Uso de tabletas para ilustrar ideas, software colaborativo para trabajar en tiempo real, o proporcionar materiales de estudio personalizados. 💻📚</li>
									<li><b>Paciencia y comprensión</b>: Entiendo que todos aprendemos a nuestro propio ritmo. Por lo tanto, mi enfoque es siempre paciente y alentador, asegurándome de que cada concepto se comprenda completamente antes de pasar al siguiente. 🤗</li>
								</ol>

						<h4 class="particular-clickable">💼 <span class="particular-h4" data-es="Experiencia previa" data-en="Previous experience"></span></h4>
						<div>

								Siempre he sido un apasionado de la informática. Mi historia con los ordenadores y la programación comenzó desde muy pequeño pero se puso en serio cuando me lancé a estudiar un <span class="underline">Grado Superior</span> de Desarrollo Web. No solo me encantó, sino que obtuve unas notas estupendas. Esto me abrió las puertas a una beca Erasmus+ para hacer prácticas en el extranjero. ¡Y sí, resulta que además de hablar informática, también hablo inglés bastante bien! 😂
								<br><br>

								Después de aquella experiencia, me sumergí en el <span class="underline">Grado en Ingeniería Informática</span> en la Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia (UCAM). Fueron años intensos y fascinantes en los que me llevé la sorpresa de mi vida al terminar con una media de 9.3 y, para mi asombro, ¡recibir el premio al mejor expediente de mi promoción! 🤯 (+26 matrículas de honor).
								<br><br>
								
								Pero mi amor por la informática y la curiosidad por seguir aprendiendo no conocían límites, así que me lancé a por un <span class="underline">Máster en Nuevas Tecnologías en Informática</span> en la Universidad de Murcia. Durante este tiempo, tuve la suerte de trabajar codo con codo con el Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) en mi Trabajo de Fin de Máster, que acabó con una calificación de 9.9. Durante esos años, también tuve la oportunidad de compartir mi pasión por la informática a través de dos artículos que publiqué en congresos nacionales.
								<br><br>
								
								Hoy, gracias a una beca de la prestigiosa Fundación Séneca (¡y estoy muy orgulloso de ser uno de los cuatro seleccionados en toda la región!), estoy metido de lleno en mis <span class="underline">estudios de doctorado</span>. Y para redondear esta aventura, también tengo la increíble oportunidad de dar clases en la Universidad de Murcia, donde este año soy el profesor encargado de las prácticas de la asignatura Arquitecturas Multinúcleo y de Propósito Específico (AMPE). ¡Así que aquí estoy, listo para compartir todo lo que he aprendido en mi camino!

						<h4 class="particular-clickable">🎓 <span class="particular-h4" data-es="Especializaciones y cursos" data-en="Specializations and courses"></span></h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								Con mi amplia formación y experiencia, puedo ayudar a estudiantes de todas las edades y niveles, desde la primaria hasta la universidad. Aquí tienes una idea de las áreas en las que me especializo:

								<ol>
									<li><b>Informática básica</b>: Desde cómo utilizar un ordenador, navegación por internet, hasta seguridad informática básica, puedo ayudar a los más jóvenes a familiarizarse y desenvolverse en el mundo digital. 🖥️</li>
									<li><b>Programación y desarrollo web</b>: ¿Estás interesado en aprender a programar o a crear tu propia página web? Puedo enseñar desde los fundamentos de la programación hasta los lenguajes más avanzados, y orientar en el diseño y desarrollo de sitios web. 💻🌐</li>
									<li><b>Asignaturas universitarias de informática</b>: Si estás cursando un Grado o Máster en Informática y necesitas ayuda extra, puedo ofrecer soporte en asignaturas de computación, arquitectura, sistemas operativos, entre otras. 🎓🔬</li>
									<li><b>Inglés Técnico</b>: Gracias a mi experiencia estudiando y trabajando en el extranjero, puedo ayudarte a mejorar tu inglés técnico y académico, una habilidad esencial en el mundo de la informática y la tecnología. 🌍🗣️</li>

								Una de las cosas que realmente diferencia mis clases de las de otras academias o profesores particulares es el enfoque práctico y colaborativo que utilizo. Para asegurarme de que mis alumnos realmente comprendan y apliquen lo que aprenden, hago uso de una variedad de herramientas didácticas y tecnológicas:
								
								<ol>
									<li><b>Tableta e iPad</b>: Utilizo mi tableta y iPad para dibujar y explicar conceptos en tiempo real durante las clases. Esto significa que tendrás una explicación visual clara de lo que estoy enseñando, lo que facilitará la comprensión y retención. 🎨📱</li>
									<li><b>Programas de dibujo</b>: Domino una serie de programas de dibujo que me permiten ilustrar ideas y conceptos de una manera fácil de entender. Así, los alumnos pueden visualizar exactamente lo que estamos discutiendo y cómo se aplica. 🖌️💡</li>
									<li><b>Herramientas colaborativas</b>: Utilizo herramientas como Miro y Draw.io, que permiten a los alumnos participar y colaborar en tiempo real. Esto significa que no solo verán lo que hago, sino que también tendrán la oportunidad de participar proactivamente y aprender haciendo. 🔄🎲</li>
								</ol>

								El uso de estas herramientas modernas y colaborativas permite a los alumnos experimentar un aprendizaje interactivo y atractivo que no solo los ayudará a entender los conceptos, sino que también les dará las habilidades prácticas que necesitarán en el mundo real.
								<br><br>
								¡El objetivo siempre es proporcionar una enseñanza de la más alta calidad y hacer del aprendizaje una experiencia agradable y valiosa! 🌟🚀
